# Introduction:
The Autonomous Drone Navigation project is a research and development initiative aimed at improving a DJI Tello drone using computer vision and machine learning. It focuses on achieving autonomous navigation, user-guided routes, and obstacle avoidance. The user-friendly Frontend System allows for easy user input, live video streaming, manual control, and AI decision overrides. Utilizing the Midas model, the project prioritizes accurate depth estimation for effective obstacle detection. The main objective is to create a functional and secure autonomous drone for surveillance, emphasizing safety and minimizing risks. This chapter provides a brief introduction to the research and development efforts behind the project, emphasizing its commitment to advancing the field through practical applications.
